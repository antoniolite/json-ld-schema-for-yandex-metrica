== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I insert the Yandex Metrica tracking code in my website =

You can insert the Yandex Metrica tracking code in your website by editing your `header.php` file in your theme or using a Custom HTML tag or Custom Tag Template with Google Tag Manager.

You can also search for some plugin to do this task, but I suggest you a Custom Template for Google Tag Manager.

= How do I check that the plugin works? =

You can wait till you see the content reports in Yandex Metrica.

Or if you can't wait or if you don't see the content reports in 1-2 days, you can activate the debug mode for Yandex Metrica and check in your browser console if everything is OK.

You can also use the structured data validator from Yandex Webmaster or Google Search Console to check that your pages includes a valid JSON-LD.

= I don't see the content reports in my Yandex Metrica tag =

First you need to activate the content reports in your tag's settings, and once your website includes the JSON-LD schema in your tracked pages, you should wait for some time before to see the content reports in your sidebar menu.

= I don't see any topic in the content report =

At the moment, looks like there is a problem in Yandex Metrica to register this element if you are using the JSON-LD Schema. Hope they fix this soon.

= What if I use others Schema plugins? =

This plugin is optimized for sending information to Yandex Metrica the way it expects. It has not been tested with other active JSON Schema plugins but Yoast SEO.

If you use Yoast SEO, you can deactivate its Schema option from the `JSON-LD Schema for Yandex Metrica` settings, so you can continue using Yoast SEO for optimizing your contents but without its JSON-LD option.

= Is there some documentation about Yandex Metrica? =

Yes, Yandex Metrica has an excellent [documentation and support](https://yandex.com/support/metrica/) for its service.
